== IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ==

This plugin primarily serves as a bridge to AI models like ChatGPT and a large set of models running through Ollama or OpenRouter.

The main idea, particularly for content generation and editing, is to provide you with a tool (Content Editor Block or TinyMCE plugin). This tool allows you to submit a prompt to the AI, and then the AI's response will be formatted and inserted into your post or TinyMCE editor.

It's important to note that the quality of the content will depend on the quality of the prompt and the model. That's why Aiify provides you with a settings panel allowing you to fine-tune the default prompts to match your needs.

So, while this plugin aims to **facilitate content generation and editing**, the user **must acknowledge the inherent limitations of AI** technology. The accuracy or appropriateness of the AI-generated content is not guaranteed and may vary based on the input provided and the selected **ai model**. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying the content before use and agree to use this tool at their own risk. The developers of this plugin assume no liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from its use. Always ensure that the generated content adheres to applicable laws and regulations.

We are always open to feedback on how to make this tool better for you, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is content copywriting? =

= What is rewriting, editing and the difference between them ? =

Editing involves reviewing and making changes to an existing piece of writing in order to improve its clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness.

Rewriting, on the other hand, involves revising the content of a piece of writing more extensively. This can include making substantial changes to the structure, tone, or focus of the piece in order to improve its overall quality and effectiveness.
